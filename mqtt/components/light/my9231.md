The MY9231/MY9291 component represents a MY9231/MY9291 LED diver chain,  in esphomelib. Communication is done with two GPIO pins (DI and DCKI) and multiple driver chips can be chained. There are two models with different number of output channels (MY9291 with 4 channels and MY9231 with 3 channels). They are popular driver chips used in smart light blubs:

To use the channels of this components, you first need to setup the global `my9231` hub and give it an id, and then define the [individual output channels](https://esphomelib.com/esphomeyaml/components/output/my9231.html).

Note

One of the features of the MY9231/MY9291 driver is that the chips remember their state after a power cycling. Unfortunately, the state of the driver can not be read. Therefore, if esphomelib can not restore the previous state, it will result in a mismatch of the driver output and the internal state (= MQTT state). So you can configure the behaviour on boot time:

- `update_on_boot: True`

  On device power up/boot, the light may flash shortly, to the state before powering off.

- `update_on_boot: False`

  On device power up/boot, the light show the last state, but the internal data will not reflect this state. Thus, the first fade is wrong, as well as the MQTT state.

# 配置示例
my9231:
  - data_pin: GPIO12
    clock_pin: GPIO14

# Individual outputs
output:
  - platform: my9231
    id: 'my9231_output1'
    channel: 0
```

## ## 配置参数

- **data_pin** (**必填**, [Pin Schema](https://esphomelib.com/esphomeyaml/guides/configuration-types.html#config-pin-schema)): The pin which DI is connected to.
- **clock_pin** (**必填**, [Pin Schema](https://esphomelib.com/esphomeyaml/guides/configuration-types.html#config-pin-schema)): The pin which DCKI is connected to.
- **num_channels** (*选填*, 整数): Total number of channels of the whole chain. Must be in range from 3 to 1020. Defaults to 6.
- **num_chips** (*选填*, 整数): Number of chips in the chain. Must be in range from 1 to 255. Defaults to 2.
- **bit_depths** (*选填*, 整数): The bit depth to use for all output channels in this chain. Must be one of 8, 12, 14 or 16. Defaults to 16.
- **update_on_boot** (*选填*, boolean): Update/reset duty data at boot. Defaults to `True`.
- **id** (*选填*, [ID](mqtt/guides/configuration-types#id)): The id to use for this `my9231` component. Use this if you have multiple MY9231/MY9291 chains connected at the same time.

## Sonoff B1 configuration example

This component can be used with a Sonoff B1 smart light blub. To flash the Sonoff B1, open the plastic cover and connect/solder wires to the PCB pads (3.3V, RX, TX, GND, GPIO0). If you connect GPIO0 to GND during power up, the device enters flash mode. For more information about flashing Sonoff devices, see: [Using With Sonoff S20](https://esphomelib.com/esphomeyaml/devices/sonoff_s20.html). All LEDs are connected to a chain of two MY9321 chips that are connected to GPIO12 and GPIO14. A complete configuration for a Sonoff B1 looks like:
