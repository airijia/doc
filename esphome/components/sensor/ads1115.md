# ADS1115 Sensor

The `ads1115` sensor allows you to use your ADS1115 sigma-delta ADC sensors ([datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads1115.pdf), [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085)) with esphomelib. First, setup a [ADS1115 Hub](https://esphome.io/components/ads1115) for your ADS1115 sensor and then use this sensor platform to create individual sensors that will report the voltage to Home Assistant.

## **配置参数**

- **multiplexer** (**必填**): The multiplexer channel of this sensor. Effectively means between which pins you want to measure voltage.
- **gain** (**必填**, float): The gain of this sensor.
- **name** (**必填**, 字符串): The name for this sensor.
- **ads1115_id** (*选填*, [ID](esphome/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID of the [ADS1115 Hub](https://esphome.io/components/ads1115) you want to use this sensor.
- **update_interval** (*选填*, [Time](https://esphome.io/guides/configuration-types#config-time)): The interval to check the sensor. Defaults to `60s`.
- **id** (*选填*, [ID](esphome/guides/configuration-types#id)): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.

## Multiplexer And Gain

The ADS1115 has a multiplexer that can be configured to measure voltage between several pin configurations. These are:

> - `A0_A1` (between Pin 0 and Pin 1)
> - `A0_A3` (between Pin 0 and Pin 3)
> - `A1_A3` (between Pin 1 and Pin 3)
> - `A2_A3` (between Pin 2 and Pin 3)
> - `A0_GND` (between Pin 0 and GND)
> - `A1_GND` (between Pin 1 and GND)
> - `A2_GND` (between Pin 2 and GND)
> - `A3_GND` (between Pin 3 and GND)

Additionally, the ADS1115 has a Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA) that can help you measure voltages in different ranges, these are:

> - `6.144` (measures up to 6.144V)
> - `4.096` (measures up to 4.096V)
> - `2.048` (measures up to 2.048V)
> - `1.024` (measures up to 1.024V)
> - `0.512` (measures up to 0.512V)
> - `0.256` (measures up to 0.256V)
